I was thinking that instead of a mahjong simulator, the game is much simpler.
You get a hand of tiles and x number of moves to game. You draw cards
"randomly" (that is, the cards are random, but in easier levels you get easier
cards). The more points you get when you game the longer you can keep playing
(so yes, one of those games that can have in-app spending associated with it).

It's missing both the dynamic results and movement interaction of Candy Crush.
Well, you can have lots of sound ("fa seong!") etc at appropriate moments (with
words written across the screen) and interaction when you select and flip(?) a
tile.
